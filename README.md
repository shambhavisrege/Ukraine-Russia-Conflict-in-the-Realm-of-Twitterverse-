# Ukraine Russia Conflict in the Realm of Twitterverse
The agitation between Russia and Ukraine has been on a rise in the past few decades since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On February 24th 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. In the days that followed, tales of a confrontation turning into war continued to pour in from laymen to news anchors. Russia was met with criticism and condemnation from throughout the world. While the war continues to worsen Ukraine's humanitarian and refugee crisis, a new warzone has formed in the internet realm, both in terms of using social media to rally support for both sides of the conflict and in terms of information warfare. In this paper we aim to analyze the trends of tweets posted during the war. To understand the shifting sentiment among people we are taking tweets for a 3-day period in the beginning of the war and 3-day period from a month later. Our aim is to understand public sentiment in the Twitterverse about the ongoing war/conflict and the evolution of the conflict on a daily basis based on the micro trends of the topics by analyzing the Tweets. We also aim to comment on the shifting support based on the influence of politics. In the end we are interested in comprehending how social media's pervasiveness has altered how modern conflict is fought both online and on the ground.
